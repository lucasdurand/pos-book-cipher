# pos-book-cipher

Check out a working example here, using some D&D source text for the book (Volo's Guide to Monsters): [http://cipher.anvil.app](http://cipher.anvil.app)

## Overview
- Produce a simple cipher from codex text
- Substitution cipher using part-of-speech to form substitution lists from source text

## Not 1:1

This is a good bit of fun, but due to the nature of the constructed cipher text, the context of words can (and will) change, resulting in a shift of POS. The result is that the plain text is generally not fully recoverable. It does a fairly good job though ;)
