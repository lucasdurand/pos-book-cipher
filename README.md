# pos-book-cipher

- Produce a simple cipher from codex text
- Substitution cipher using part-of-speech to form substitution lists from source text

This is a good bit of fun, but due to the nature of the constructed cipher text, the context of words can (and will) change, resulting in a shift of POS. The result is that the plain text is generally not fully recoverable. It does a fairly good job though ;)
