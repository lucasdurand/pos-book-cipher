VOLO HAS ENCOUNTERED MANY MONSTERS
in his day, few as odious or as ornery as
the ones described herein. This chapter
takes several iconic D&D monsters and
provides additional information about
their orjgins, their dispositions and
behaviors, and their lairs-above and
beyond what is written in the Monster Manual. To give
every monster such grand treatment would require too
many pages to count, so we winnowed down the list to
nine groups of creatures that have a lot going for them
and tend to get used often in D&D campaigns:
Beholders Goblinoids Mind flayers
Giants Hags Ores
Gnolls Kobolds Yuan-ti
If you plunder this chapter for ideas and maps the
next time you create an adventure or a villain, then this
material has served its purpose. We hope that, as you
explore each monster section, you'll come up with new
ways to challenge and entertain your players, as well as
find new things that you can borrow for your own D&D
campaign. Let each entry spark your imagination!
You might be wondering why certain monsters were
chosen above others. Where are dragons and githyanki?
What, no fiends or undead? We hope to tackle other
monsters in other products over time. Until then, mind
the kobolds hiding under the stairs, and beware of hags
bearing strange gifts.
BEHOLDERS: BAD DREAMS
COME TRUE
To those who would seek to conquer beholders or
merely understand them, nearly everything about their
quarry is unfathomable. These bizarre creatures are
possessed of alien intelligence, inhuman forms of perception, and the ability to shape reality through force
of will-or even by their mere presence. Inside the
comfortable confines of its subterranean lair, a beholder
is nearly unassailable thanks to the combination of its
peerless intellect and the brutal effects of its eye rays.
Some of the behaviors and motivations that beholders
exhibit are analogous to those of humans and other intelligent creatures. The difference is one of degree. For
instance, where a prideful, confident human might be
cowed by a serious threat, the arrogance of a beholder
knows no such bounds: it believes that it is superior to
every other creature, even including other beholders. A
human chess player becomes a master by honing the
ability to look several moves ahead during a gamewhich is still no match for what a beholder can accomplish with its superior intelligence and awareness.
The mind of a beholder is powerful and versatile
enough that it can envision literally any possibility, and
it prepares accordingly, making it virtually impossible
for any invaders to catch it unawares. This way of thinking could be interpreted as a form of paranoia- and
if so, it would be the most extreme form imaginable.
While a human tyrant might be rightfully paranoid
about unperceived threats, a beholder is paranoid even
though it perceives everything, because that attitude is
the natural companion to eternal vigilance.
Beholders are among the few creatures that can shape
reality in their vicinity. In addition, beholders don't
truly sleep when they rest. Instead, a beholder's mind
remains semiconscious even as it dreams. As a result,
on rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another
beholder, the dream-reality becomes warped and takes
on physical form, becoming another actual beholder.
To call this process reproduction would be inaccurate,
because in most cases the old and new beholders fight
to the death- a fact for which the rest of the world
is thankful.
INHUMAN INTELLECT
A beholder sees in all directions. It is always looking for
concealed attackers. Even when it sleeps, its smaller
eyes remain open, scanning its lair for threats. If a human acted this way, the constant vigilance and lack of
truly peaceful rest would lead to a dangerous level of
psychosis, but a beholder's mind accepts this attitude as
normal and necessary- it is always alert to the possibility of assassination or betrayal by unknown threats that
stand ready to pounce on the beholder the instant it lets
its guard down.
Complementing this ever-present, passive paranoia is
the beholder's genius-level intelligence. Where another
creature would ignore the occurrence of two seemingly
unrelated events as merely coincidental, a beholder
imagines multiple ways they could be related, finding
or fabricating a pattern out of supposed or actual randomness. By thinking of all these possibilities- however
implausible they might be-and extrapolating its own
actions in response, a beholder is truly prepared for any
situation and has a strategy to counteract it.
A beholder has plans on top of plans, even for the
least likely circumstances. It doesn't matter if invading
adventurers arrive at its lair with summoned angel allies
or enslaved demons, by breaking through the floor, by
teleporting or riding dinosaurs, or girded with layers of
magical defenses and armed with advanced weapons. In
any case, the beholder's reaction is calculated, because
it has thought about what it and its minions must do in
response to every situation.
DESPOTIC PERSPECTIVE
A beholder believes it is superior to all other entities.
Unintelligent foes are regarded as food or pets. An intelligent creature is seen as food or a potential minion.
A beholder's true rivals are other beholders, for only
another beholder has the intellect, power, and magic to
threaten another of its kind.
Most of a beholder's mental activity is devoted to
unearthing plots against itself (real or imaginary), planning attacks against known rivals, and preparing its
defenses against all possible threats. It considers itself
the center of the world, in a narcissistic way; of course
the clan of duergar moving into its territory is because a
rival is trying to oust it, of course the gang of adventurers in its lair were sent to kill it by a cowardly rival, and
so on, because it is the perfect example of beholderness
and all other creatures are jealous.
A beholder's arrogance is a prominent aspect of its
personality. Although it isn't inclined to brag of its superiority, especially in combat, it is dismissive of its
opponents' efforts and insulting of their abilities and
failures. An exceptional challenger can earn a measure
of respect- enough that the beholder might be merciful
and pacify the creature with a charm ray or a sleep ray
instead of killing it outright. Of course, this mercy has
a purpose; the defeated opponent is interrogated, subjugated, and offered a role in the beholder's retinue once
its will is broken. A beholder might consider a group
of skilled adventurers to be a valuable prize and use
its abilities to capture them all for this purpose, giving
them the opportunity to serve as guards, spies, or assassins against a rival. Refusal means, at best, servitude as
a charmed minion, and at worst, disintegration.
BIRTH OF A BEHOLDER
Beholders can produce others of their own kind, but the
process has nothing to do with biology and everything to
do with psychology.
When a beholder sleeps, its body goes briefly dormant
but its mind never stops working. The creature is fully
aware, even though to an outside observer it might appear oblivious of its surroundings. Sometimes a beholder's dreams are dominated by images of itself or of other
beholders (which might or might not actually exist). On
extremely rare occasions when a beholder dreams of
another beholder, the act creates a warp in reality- from
which a new, fully formed beholder springs forth unbidden, seemingly having appeared out of thin air in a
nearby space. This "offspring" might be a duplicate of
the beholder that dreamed it into existence, or it could
take the form of a different variety of beholder, such as a
death kiss or a gazer (see "Beholder-Kin"). It might also
be a truly unique creature, such as could be spawned 

only from the twisted imagination of a beholder, with
a set of magical abilities unlike that of its parent. In
most cases, the process yields one of the three principal
forms of the beholder: a solitary beholder, a hive, or a
death tyrant.
SOLITARY BEHOLDERS
Most of the beholders in the world live apart from others
of their kind, and they like it that way. When a solitary
beholder dreams another beholder into existence, the
creatures' basic nature often means that the first thing
they do is try to destroy one another. A solitary beholder
lairs within a cave system or a ruined structure, either
one of its own making or a place the creature took over
after killing or driving off the beholder that gave it birth.
A solitary beholder gathers (or inherits) inferior creatures that it uses as minions. These creatures help
defend the lair and also serve as shock troops if the
beholder vacates its lair to prey on the inhabitants of
the surrounding area. Often, it plunders its neighbors'
homes for knowledge and treasure. After the beholder
secures the spoils it desires from its enemies, it allows
its minions to divide the remaining booty.
EYE TYRANTS
An eye tyrant is a solitary beholder that has suppressed
its xenophobia and paranoia and chooses to live as the
leader or ruler of a community or an organization that
includes other creatures. This doesn't mean that the
eye tyrant likes, respects, or understands the creatures
it chooses to associate with, but it does distinguish between individuals of other races and communicates with
them on a regular basis. An eye tyrant is still ruthless at
eliminating threats to itself, whether from another beholder or some other powerful creature-it just doesn't
have an insane fear that any creature not under its
direct control is working for an enemy. Most known beholders who choose to interact with humanoid society in
any way are eye tyrant,s. For an example of an eye tyrant
that leads an organization of humanoids, see the section
on the Xanathar Guild.
BEHOLDER HIVES
In exceedingly rare cases, a beholder might experience
a dream in which it sees itself in a mirror, or encounters
several copies of itself, or imagines a sensation akin to
what humanoids call multiple personalities. At such a
time, the beholder's dream-birthing creates a beholder
hive-a group of "newborns" that are identical to its own
shape but smaller.
When the dreamer awakens, it treats the newborns as
extensions of its own self in other bodies, and therefore
isn't consumed with an urge to kill them. This united
group of identical beholders doesn't truly have a hive
intelligence, but their personalities and goals are so
similar that they can predict and assume each others'
behavior, much as especially close human siblings can.
The original beholder is usually the dominant one and
takes a leadership role. A hive consists of three to ten
beholders, plus whatever minions they control.
DEATH TYRANTS
As a beholder ages, it spends more and more time
worrying about its mortality. The dreams of such a
death-fearing beholder might reach into strange corners
of reality and imagine circumstances in which the creature can live on after death. When the beholder awakens, it finds itself transformed into a death tyrant. It now
exists in a state of undeath- yet its fear of being killed
remains unabated.
A death tyrant's paranoia about its enemies tends to
be related to how it fears it will be destroyed, and its
plans take that fear into account. For example, a death
tyrant who imagined it would eventually be slain by frost
giants might relocate its lair to the inside of a volcano,
send its minions to hunt down all frost giants within 100
miles, or take some other drastic measure to ensure
that the fear never becomes reality.
BEHOLDER-KIN
The lesser creatures known as beholder-kin bear a
superficial resemblance to true beholders in that each
has a floating spherical body with eyes. That's where the
similarity ends.
Chapter 3 of this book introduces several new types
of beholder-kin. A death kiss is usually the result of a
nightmare about blood, such as what a beholder might
experience after an encounter with a vampire or after
being severely wounded in battle. Gazers are "born" out
of a poisoned or ill beholder's feverish dreams, in which
its sense of perspective and scale is warped. A spectator (see the Monster Manual) is a kind of lesser beholder
summoned from another plane of existence to watch 
over somethingt such as a treasure hoard. A gauth hails
from the same plane as spectators, or one that overlaps
it enough that they can take advantage of a flawed attempt to summon a spectator. Although true beholders
can be found on a spectatorts or gauth's home plane, the
creatures' actual place of origin is unknown (whether
another plane, a world beyond the stars, or some
stranger location), and spectators and gauths aren't believed to originate from dreams as other beholders do.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
As a byproduct of their unique method of propagation,
beholders in one part of the world tend to look similar,
with variations becoming more pronounced the farther
one travels from that area. Even a slight variation in the
shape of an eyestalk or the texture of its skin is enough
for one beholder to consider another a flawed abomination, which should be destroyed.
Use the following tables to produce a variety of different appearances for beholders

ROLEPLAYING A BEHOLDER
A beholder constantly fears for its safety, is wary of any
creature that isn't one of its minions, and is aggressive
in dealing with perceived threats. It might react favorably toward creatures that humble themselves before it
and present themselves as inferiors, but is easily provoked to attack creatures that brag about their accom-
plishments or claim to be mighty. Such creatures are
seen as threats or fools, and are dealt with mercilessly.
Each beholder thinks it is the epitome of its race, and
therefore all other beholders are inferior to it-even
though, at the same time, it considers other beholders to
be its greatest rivals. A beholder might be willing to cooperate with adventurers who have news about another
beholder's lair or activities, and might be nonhostile
toward adventurers who praise it for being a perfect example of a beholder.
The tables that follow present possibilities for personal characteristics that you can use to make a beholder distinctive.

BEHOLDER NAMES
A beholder picks its own name, piecing together sounds
and syllables that have significance and meaning to it. 

BATTLE TACTICS
A beholder analyzes its opponents, makes note of armor,
weapons, and tactics, and adjusts its strategy to eliminate the most dangerous threats as quickly as possible.
Although a beholder's specific actions will vary with
each encounter, the creature's behavior is largely governed by the tactics discussed below.
STAY OUT OF RANGE AND SIGHT
A beholder's natural ability to fly is essential to many of
its defenses and habits. Portions of its lair- especially
the remote part where it sleeps- usually aren't reachable on foot, which makes it harder for its minions to
take over the lair, and forces intruders to find ways to
overcome steep vertical climbs.
Also, a beholder's natural levitation means it doesn't
risk activating any floor-based traps, and therefore it is
likely to use such defenses to protect its inner sanctum,
allowing it to roam freely through the area while hostiles must dodge or overcome multiple obstacles.
Unless its opponents are concealed by fog, invisibility,
or some other magic, a beholder can lurk in the dark 
and shoot any creature it can see within the range of its
darkvision. A dark room with a 120-foot ceiling allows it
to use this tactic, requiring opponents to create light at a
distance in order to return fire with any accuracy.
Even intruders who don't need light to see have to contend with the beholder's superior senses-the monster
can see its opponents before 60-foot darkvision sees it.
USE ANTI MAGIC FREELY
Although a beholder can't use its rays on targets inside
the area of its antimagic cone, the ability of its central
eye is incredibly effective in combat-instantly crippling
enemy spellcasters, revealing the exact location of anyone using blur or invisibility, and causing opponents
using magical flight to plummet to the ground. The cone
is wide enough that the beholder can usually redirect it
toward any particular creature trying to escape the area,
keeping that target locked down until the monster has
killed all the enemies outside the cone.
A beholder can use its telekinesis ray in conjunction
with its antimagic cone to lift a heavy object above the
cone and drop it onto an opponent inside the cone; gravity finishes the job, even though the cone negates the
beholder's telekinetic control.
The ability to temporarily suspend magical effects
is useful to a beholder for determining if a minion has
been charmed or compelled to act against its master;
the creature might change its behavior when inside the
cone, or it might remember or be able to speak of things
it was compelled to forget or keep secret.
Because the cone suppresses ongoing magical effects, the beholder might create a secure area in its lair
behind a permanent wall of .ire or wall of force, make
use of an existing magical hazard (such as a pool that
transforms any creature that touches it), or an area with
magical guardians (such as an old shrine with a demon
bound to it) that it can bypass.
USE EYE RAYS TO BEST EFFECT
A beholder can fire multiple eye rays on its turn, and it
might use all of them in succession on its most dangerous foe. Even a very tough fighter is going to have second thoughts after taking damage from a disintegration
ray, an enervation ray, and a death ray.
A beholder can shift its targets after its first or second
rays. For example, if a beholder intends to shoot charm,
slowing, and sleep rays at a ranger, and the ranger succumbs to the charm, the beholder could use its remaining rays against other targets.
USE LEGENDARY ACTIONS
The beholder's ability to use legendary actions effectively doubles the number of times it can shoot rays in
a round. Each legendary action a beholder takes gives
it an opportunity to react to a change in circumstances,
or to press an assault that it began on its turn. For instance, it might use its sleep ray as a legendary action
against an enemy that has just been awakened. If no
such opportunity presents itself, legendary actions are
always useful for piling rays on the most dangerous foe. 

USE TRAPS AND MINIONS
A beholder in its lair has access to so many resources
that it can often vanquish invaders without directly confronting them. Devious and hidden traps are liable to
be lurking around every corner, and might be blatantly
obvious in some places, yet no less lethal. In similar
fashion, a beholder might station some of its minions
in a prime spot for an ambush, or it might send forth a
bunch of its servants to overrun a group of enemies that
have been weakened by traps and other hazards. Every
beholder has minions, and can always acquire more, so
the master of the lair doesn't hesitate to send its underlings into the fray.
OUTSIDE COMBAT
As described in the Monster Manual, a beholder's use
of its eye rays in combat is random, governed by die
rolls instead of by choice. This rule is an abstraction,
designed to keep the beholder's opponents unsure of
what rays will be coming next (and, not incidentally, to
prevent the monster from using its most lethal eye rays
at every opportunity). The rule also makes the creature
easier to run.
In the safety of its lair, outside the view of any
would-be enemies, a beholder can use any of its eye rays
whenever it wants to. Many of them serve as tools.
ANTIMAGIC CONE
The magic-nullifying effect of a beholder's central eye
has a number of possible uses outside combat, but if it's
not needed, the beholder can turn it off by simply closing the eye.
NEGATIVE ENERGY CONE
Normally usable only by a death tyrant, negative energy
prevents survivors of a battle from healing and animates
any dead or dying creatures as zombies under the beholder's control. Because there is no limit to the number
of zombies a death tyrant can animate and control,
it can pack its lair so full of undead that there is little
space for anyone to walk, creating a shambling barrier
of cadaverous resistance against any invasion.
CHARM RAY
It is common for a beholder to charm a hostile monster,
lure the creature to the beholder's lair, and confine it
there so it can't escape under its own power. In this way,
even monsters that can't be bribed or coerced can be
useful to a beholder, making its lair a confusing zoo of
hostile beasts.
Although each use of the charm effect lasts only an
hour, repeated uses over time against the same target
tend to wear down a creature's will, creating a docile servant.
PARALYZING RAY
Outside combat, the paralyzing ray is most often used
to restrain a fleeing minion that it doesn't want to destroy outright. 

FEAR RAY
A beholder uses its fear ray to psychologically torture
and interrogate a prisoner until the creature loses the
will to resist.
SLOWING RAY
A beholder might use its slowing ray on an uncooperative creature as a demonstration of sorts, threatening to
follow it up with more severe consequences if the creature doesn't submit to the beholder's will.
DEATH RAY AND ENERVATION RAY
A beholder can fine-tune its death ray or enervation ray
so that it can "zap" the smallest of targets and deal only
a small amount of damage (though usually still enough
to obliterate what it touches). For example, to guard
against magical spying, a beholder might use either ray
to eliminate all common vermin (bats, rats, spiders, and
so on) from its lair.
TELEKINETIC RAY
In addition to functioning as the beholder's arms and
hands for everyday tasks, the telekinetic ray is essential
for building traps and other lair defenses, such as positioning the weights for a falling block trap. This ray allows a beholder to station its minions in parts of the lair
that can otherwise be accessed only by climbing or flying, preventing the occupants from escaping. A beholder
could also use its telekinetic ray to forcibly transport a
creature immune to charm effects (such as a construct
or some kinds of undead).
SLEEP RAY
When it parlays with other creatures, a beholder might
use its sleep ray as a display of power, quickly disabling
the leader and thereby persuading the rest of the group
to mount no resistance. This tactic is useful primarily
when the beholder intends to use the group for its own
purposes, and keeping the leader alive is advantageous
to those plans. This ray is also used to pacify potentially
useful captives, perhaps in preparation for conditioning
them with the charm or fear rays. 	

PETRIFICATION RAY
The most mundane function of the petritication ray is
as a means of decorating a beholder's lair with statues.
Beyond that, this ray has a multitude of uses. An unruly
minion could be turned to stone, eliminating the creature as a threat and creating a permanent reminder of
the price of disobeying the beholder. A beholder might
use loosely scattered petrified creatures to create obstacles in an open chamber, or pack them tightly in a corridor to seal off an area, or use them as falling hazards
instead of heavy blocks in order to engender fear and
uncertainty among intruders.
DISINTEGRATION RAY
A beholder's disintegration ray is a useful tool for excavation. The beholder can also manipulate the ray with
pinpoint control, enabling it to cut and shape objects
as though it were wielding a fine chisel, drill holes too
small for an arrow to pass through, carve masonry
blocks out of raw stone, amputate limbs, or brand creatures with burn-like scars. This ray and the telekinetic
ray are the basis for a beholder's ability to shape its lair
to its very specific and exacting needs, whether sculpting rooms or fabricating traps.
VARIANT ABILITIES
When a beholder's dream-imagination runs wild, the
result can be an offspring that has an unusual or unique
set of abilities. Rather than the standard powers of a beholder's central eye and eyestalks, the creature has one
or more variant abilities-guaranteed to surprise any
enemies who thought they knew what they were getting
themselves into.
This section provides several alternative spell effects
for a beholder's eye. Each of these effects is designed
to be of the same power level as the one it replaces, enabling you to create a custom beholder without altering
the monster's challenge rating. As another option, you
can switch any of the damaging eye rays in the Monster
Manual to an effect with a different damage type, such
as replacing the enervation ray with a combustion ray
that deals fire damage instead of necrotic damage.
Unless otherwise indicated, an alternative ability
has the same range as the eye ray it is replacing, and it
affects only one creature per use (even if the ability is
based on a spell that normally affects an area or multiple targets) . The saving throw for an alternative ability
uses the same DC and the same ability score as the
spell the eye ray is based on.
Antimagic Cone: mirage arcane, power word stun (affecting the
weakest non-stunned target in the cone each round)
Charm Ray: banishment (l minute), confusion (1 minute)
Death Ray: circle of death (10-foot-radius sphere; 4d6 necrotic
damage to all creatures in the area),feeblemind
Disintegration Ray: chain lightning (primary target takes 6d8
lightning damage; two secondary targets within 30 feet of the
primary target take 3d8 lightning damage each), eyebite (sickened effect; l minute)
Enervation Ray: create undead (usable regardless of the time of
day), polymorph (l minute)
Fear Ray: gaseous form (self or willing creature only), moonbeam
Paralyzing Ray: modify memory, silence (l minute)
Petrification Ray: Otto's irresistible dance (1 minute), wall of ice
(1 minute; one 10-foot-square panel}
Sleep Ray: blindness/deafness, misty step (self or willing
creature only)
Slowing Ray: bestow curse (l minute), sleet storm (one
l 0-foot-cube)
Telekinesis Ray: geas (1 hour), wall of force (1 minute; one
l 0-foot-sq uare panel) 
BEHOLDER LAIRS
The lair of a beholder is a reflection of the creature's
mind-set- designed to anticipate, and thwart, any plan
that would-be invaders might devise. Each of its chambers is isolated, accessible from only one or two other
areas, giving the beholder control over the route that enemies must take to reach the sanctum where the owner
of the place lies in wait.
A beholder usually creates its lair in an area of natural
caves, shaping the chambers with its disintegration ray.
Most of the entryways and passages that it fashions to
connect one chamber with another are too narrow to
admit creatures larger than itself (particularly in the
innermost chambers). If any large openings between
adjacent caves exist naturally, the beholder constricts or
seals off such openings, either by employing slave labor
or by collapsing the tunnel itself.
Regardless of its overall configuration, every beholder's lair is oriented to take full advantage of the creature's flight ability. Adjoining chambers are connected
by vertical or steeply sloped tunnels that the beholder
carves out of the surrounding stone, each passage
barely large enough to admit the beholder's body. Enemies that are too big to traverse these smooth-walled
tunnels will find it difficult to move deep into the lair
and virtually impossible to confront the beholder in
its sanctum.
Minions and other creatures under a beholder's control generally have their own living spaces in the lair.
Because a beholder's minions are typically not able to
fly, many of these chambers are connected to others by
staircases or gently sloping ramps in addition to the tunnels, so the beholder can easily move its minions around
as the need arises.
Common rooms found in a beholder's lair are described in the sections that follow.
CENTRAL GALLERY
The main living area that the beholder uses is filled
with objects that the creature enjoys looking at, such as
art, statues, and its latest spoils of victory. The floor is
uneven and difficult for intruders to navigate. Minions
usually guard the entrances to this chamber.
ESCAPE TuNNELS
A lair has several escape tunnels, each closed off inside
the lair by a large boulder or a mortared stone wall.
Most of these routes are blocked on both ends, preventing creatures from easily entering the lair through anywhere but the main entrance. The beholder, of course,
can disintegrate these barriers to gain access to the
tunnel. As with the tunnels between chambers, escape
tunnels are usually a steep climb or nearly vertical to
make it difficult for non-flying creatures to follow. A tunnel bends every 50 to 100 feet to prevent attackers from
shooting at the beholder while it flees, but giving the
monster opportunities to attack when its enemies come
into view. Many escape tunnels have falling block traps
or weak ceilings supported by a single pillar, which the
beholder can disintegrate after it passes that p

wall. A typical simple door trap is a pivoting spiked arm
that swings downward to impale an intruder when the
door is opened.
Ceiling Trap. In addition to making use of classic
"gravity traps" such as the collapsing roof, the falling
net, and the rolling sphere, a beholder can use its disintegration ray to blast a hole in the ceiling above its enemies, opening up a previously prepared chamber filled
with mud, water, sand, garbage, green slime, petrified
enemies, poison gas, swarms of centipedes, zombies, or
any other sort of hazardous material or creatures.
Gas Spores. One form of gas spore trap is nothing
more than a small room or section of tunnel that contains one or more hovering gas spores. The passage
leading to it is sealed off or constricted to prevent the
fungus creatures from drifting into inhabited areas.
Medium or smaller intruders can easily move through
the passage but might have little warning about what
lies ahead, especially if the passage has sharp turns that
make it likely that the gas spore isn't seen until the last
moment. A beholder might use its telekinesis ray to forcibly push a gas spore into an opponent, making the gas
spore explode.
Obstacle Course. If its lair includes a long, narrow
chamber with an uneven floor and multiple terraces, a
beholder might turn this area into a killing ground. The
floors count as difficult terrain, and the terraces mean
that in some places climbing or jumping down is required to make progress. These areas are often seeded
with perils both stationary and mobile. The beholder
and its minions can bypass the area by means of secret
doors at either end. Some obstacle courses feature low
walls to slow enemies even further or a portcullis to trap
them in one section of the chamber.
Oil Sprayer. The main element of an oil sprayer trap
is a large tank, filled with oil, embedded into the top of
a column or located in a space above the trapped room.
When the trap is triggered, a valve in the bottom of the
tank opens, and oil spews into the room, making the
floor slick and igniting if any open flames are present.
TROPHY GALLERY
A beholder that has amassed many trophies might set
aside an area in its lair dedicated to their display. A
trophy gallery is often a long chamber decorated with
mementos taken from creatures the beholder has slain.
Niches and pedestals hold smaller objects, while larger
objects are suspended from the ceiling or left freestanding in the room. To prevent minions from handling or
trying to steal trophies, the more favored and valuable
items are kept on high shelves, accessible to the flying
beholder but out of reach of anyone on the ground.
LEAVING THE LAIR
A beholder goes to a lot of trouble to make its lair as
safe and comfortable as it possibly can, and so it rarely
ventures outside. A typical beholder would primarily
be concerned with securing the area in a 1-mile radius
around its lair (corresponding to the area of the beholder's regional effects), but could range even farther if the
need arises. It might leave home to confront or forestall
the advance of creatures that it sees as threats, or to
capture a new pack of minions, or to go after a particularly enticing trophy.
When a beholder goes on the offensive against a
threat outside its lair, it plans ahead and makes use of
all of its advantages. For example, if it decides a newly
settled human village nearby is a threat, it and its minions will set up camp nearby and scout the area (usually
by flying high overhead at night using darkvision) for
one or two days. Once the layout and guard movements
are known, the beholder sends its minions to attack or
draw out defenders while it flies high overhead and uses
its eye rays to subdue the village, targeting leaders and
other formidable foes before significant resistance can
be mounted.
One of these raids usually lasts less than an hour, after which the beholder withdraws its forces, leaving the
terrified survivors to wonder when the next attack will
occur. Unless they flee, the beholder and its forces return night after night, each time eliminating key defenders, and ultimately breaking the morale of the survivors,
at which point the beholder's minions can capture anyone or anything worth keeping and raze the settlement.
TREASURE
A beholder carefully scrutinizes all the treasure in its
lair and divides the booty into five groups: tools, gifts,
hazards, trophies, and clutter.
A tool is any treasure that the beholder can use as
personal gear. A beholder's body can't use many kinds of
humanoid-type magic items because it doesn't have the
body parts to wear them; for example, it can't use gloves
or boots because it doesn't have hands or feet. But a
beholder could wear magic rings on its eyestalks or affix
a magic cloak to its back, and the items function as they
would if used by a humanoid.
At your discretion, a beholder might be able to use
magic items that must be held to activate, such as
wands; the beholder is assumed to be using its telekinesis eye ray to move and point the item in the same way
that a humanoid would use its hand. A beholder can't
attune to items that require attunement by a spellcaster
or a member of a certain class.
A gift is a treasure the beholder can't use itself but
that would be useful to a minion, such as magic gloves,
boots, armor, or an item it can't attune itself to. Usually
a beholder gives gifts to make a minion more powerful
and better at its job, which typically involves guarding
the beholder's lair. Sometimes it uses gifts as rewards
and incentives for exceptional minions; although it
prefers to rule by coercion and fear, it understands that
better results can sometimes be achieved by rewarding
positive behavior instead of punishing negative behavior.
A hazard can be put to use in an offensive, defensive,
or utilitarian capacity. Beholders are skilled at repurposing cursed or dangerous items as elements of traps
or obstacles in its lair, especially if such an item emits
an ongoing effect that it can suppress as needed with its
antimagic cone.
A trophy is a treasure that a beholder cherishes as
evidenee of its power, or serves as a remembrance of
victory over its enemies, or evokes another sort of positive reaction from it. The preserved corpse of a rival be-
holder (or any parts it can recover from a battle) would
certainly be a prized trophy, as would be the skull of a
defeated dragon, the clothing of a famous adventurer
the beholder killed, or art objects that are pleasing to its
alien senses. A beholder usually has the location of all
its trophies memorized and immediately senses if something is missing or out of place.
Clutter is treasure that has intrinsic value, but isn't
immediately useful to the beholder or its minions. This
category includes currency, gems, jewelry, and magic
items that nobody in the lair can use or use well. These
items are stored somewhere in the lair until they're disposed of-sometimes by distributing them among the
minions as gifts, other times by disintegration.
A beholder's personality greatly influences how it
categorizes its treasures. A braggart beholder might
use a slain enemy's magic battleaxe as a trophy, but a
manipulative beholder might give that axe as a gift to a
lieutenant in order to encourage competition between its
upper ranks. An inventive beholder might use an eversmoking bottle to obscure dozens of pit traps in a room,
but a more militaristic one might not have a use for it
and treat it as clutter. Circumstances might change the
role of a piece of treasure-a staff of the python used to
prop up a stone block trap might be given as a gift if the
beholder acquires a minion who can attune the item.
MINIONS AND PETS
Beholders often make use of minions. Establishing control over these creatures usually involves the use of its
eye rays, but eventually the minions come to understand
that the beholder can kill them whenever it wants and it
is in their best interest to stop resisting and just obey the
beholder's orders.
Minions build walls in the beholder's lair, distribute
food to other residents, and carve out new living spaces
for themselves and other minions- tasks that the beholder considers beneath its personal attention. Some
even worship the beholder as an angry, capricious deity.
Three tables-Beholder Lesser Minions, Beholder
Greater Minions, and Beholder Pets- make it easy to
stock a beholder's lair with such creatures.
LESSER MINIONS
If a beholder's retinue were likened to an army, the
grunts would be represented by its lesser minions, intelligent creatures that can talk and usually live in large
groups. They handle menial tasks for the beholder such
as hunting, scouting, and guarding the lair.
GREATER MINIONS
A beholder's greater minions are formidable opponents.
In the lair, they might be stationed where they can catch
intruders in an ambush, or they could be a last line of
defense against foes that threaten the inner sanctum.
PETS
A beholder often has one or more pets in its lair, mainly
because (for whatever reason) it enjoys the company of
such creatures. Pets are usually of low intelligence and
are kept around because of their combat abilities, entertainment value, or trophy status.
